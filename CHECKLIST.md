- [ ] See advice popup with rewritten speech
- [ ] Click "Get Actionable Advice" on Audio Analysis  
- [ ] See vocal exercise recommendations
- [ ] Click "Get Actionable Advice" on Visual Analysis
- [ ] See facial expression tips

---

## Performance Check

### Expected Timings
- [ ] Backend startup: < 10 seconds
- [ ] First analysis: 30-60 seconds (includes model download)
- [ ] Subsequent analyses: 20-40 seconds
- [ ] Advice generation: 3-5 seconds each

### If Slower Than Expected
- [ ] Check internet connection (for Gemini API)
- [ ] Check CPU usage (should not max out)
- [ ] Try shorter video (15-20 seconds)
- [ ] Check terminal for error messages

---

## Troubleshooting Completed

If any issues occurred:
- [ ] Reviewed `TESTING.md` for solutions
- [ ] Checked all error messages in terminals
- [ ] Verified API key is correct
- [ ] Confirmed all dependencies installed
- [ ] Tried restarting backend/frontend
- [ ] Checked browser console (F12) for errors

---

## Ready for Demo

### Preparation
- [ ] Prepare 30-second test speech
- [ ] Good lighting setup
- [ ] Quiet environment
- [ ] Camera at eye level
- [ ] Test internet connection

### Demo Flow
- [ ] Start both servers
- [ ] Open frontend in browser
- [ ] Record practice speech
- [ ] Add meaningful context
- [ ] Upload and show analysis
- [ ] Request advice for each section
- [ ] Explain insights to audience

---

## Production Deployment (Optional)
